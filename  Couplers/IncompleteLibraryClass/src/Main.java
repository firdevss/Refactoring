/*
Refactoring an incomplete library class involves completing its functionalities and making it more robust and usable. Let's consider a simple example of an incomplete library class in Java, which is meant to perform basic arithmetic operations.
In this example, the IncompleteCalculator class is incomplete as it lacks proper error handling, documentation, and extensibility.
 We introduced an Operation interface with a perform method to represent various arithmetic operations.
Two concrete operation classes, Addition and Subtraction, implement the Operation interface, each performing the respective operation.
The Calculator class now has a calculate method that takes an Operation instance along with operands and performs the operation.
In the main method, we demonstrate how to use the Calculator class to perform addition and subtraction operations.
This refactoring makes the code more extensible, maintainable, and readable by separating concerns and adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();

        // Perform addition
        Operation addition = new Addition();
        int resultAddition = calculator.calculate(addition, 10, 5);
        System.out.println("Addition result: " + resultAddition);

        // Perform subtraction
        Operation subtraction = new Subtraction();
        int resultSubtraction = calculator.calculate(subtraction, 10, 5);
        System.out.println("Subtraction result: " + resultSubtraction);
