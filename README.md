 Refactoring Techniques :
          This Repository applied to general Refactoring techniques that is describe actual refactoring
          steps. Most refactoring techniques have their
          pros and cons. Therefore, each refactoring
          should be properly motivated and
          applied with caution


Refactoring
          Refactoring is a systematic process of improving code
          without creating new functionality that can transform
          a mess into clean code and simple design.

Dirty Code
        Dirty code is result of inexperience
        multiplied by tight deadlines,
        mismanagement, and nasty
        shortcuts taken during the
        development process.

Clean Code
        Clean code is code that is easy to read,
        understand and maintain. Clean code makes
        software development predictable
        and increases the quality
        of a resulting product

Refactoring Process
        Performing refactoring step-by-step and
        running tests after each change are key
        elements of refactoring that make it
        predictable and safe.

Code Smells
        Code smells are indicators of problems that can be
        addressed during refactoring. Code smells are
        easy to spot and fix, but they may be just
symptoms of a deeper problem
with code.
