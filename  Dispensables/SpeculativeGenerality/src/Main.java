/*
"Speculative Generality" refers to the inclusion of overly complex or generic functionality in anticipation of future requirements that may never arise. It often results in unnecessary complexity and bloat in the codebase. Refactoring speculative generality involves removing or simplifying overly complex or generic code that isn't currently needed. Let's refactor a Java class with speculative generality
 uppose we have a class Utils that contains generic methods that are not currently used:
In this example, the Utils class contains generic methods for merging, filtering, and transforming data. However, these methods are not currently used in the application and may have been included based on speculation about future requirements.

To refactor this speculative generality, we can remove the unused generic methods and simplify the class:
In this refactoring, we've removed the unused generic methods and replaced them with a simpler, more specific merge method for merging strings. This simplifies the Utils class and eliminates the speculative generality, making the codebase cleaner and easier to understand.
